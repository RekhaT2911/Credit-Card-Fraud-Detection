# Credit Card Fraud Detection

This project focuses on detecting fraudulent credit card transactions using machine learning techniques. The goal is to build a classification model that can accurately distinguish between legitimate and fraudulent transactions based on historical data.

## Dataset

The dataset used is `credit_card_fraud_sample.csv`, which includes:

- 30 columns: `Time`, `V1` to `V28`, `Amount`, and `Class`
- Anonymized features using PCA for confidentiality
- Highly imbalanced classes (fraudulent transactions are rare)
- `Class`: target column where 0 = legitimate, 1 = fraud

## Problem Statement

Given the dataset of transactions, the objective is to:

- Detect fraudulent transactions with high precision and recall
- Handle data imbalance effectively
- Evaluate and compare different classification algorithms

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/credit-card-fraud-detection.git
cd credit-card-fraud-detection
````

2. Create and activate a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

3. Install required libraries:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

1. Place the `credit_card_fraud_sample.csv` file inside the `data/` directory.
2. Run the analysis notebook or script:

```bash
jupyter notebook notebooks/credit_card_fraud_detection.ipynb
```

or

```bash
python src/train_model.py
```

## Modeling Approach

Steps followed in the model pipeline:

1. Data preprocessing and cleaning
2. Handling class imbalance (e.g., SMOTE or under-sampling)
3. Feature scaling (StandardScaler)
4. Train-test split using stratified sampling
5. Model training using:

   * Logistic Regression
   * Random Forest
   * XGBoost
6. Evaluation on test data

## Evaluation Metrics

Since the dataset is imbalanced, we use the following metrics:

* Accuracy
* Precision
* Recall
* F1 Score
* ROC AUC Score
* Confusion Matrix

## Results

* Models were evaluated and compared using cross-validation.
* Precision-Recall tradeoff was analyzed.
* Logistic Regression and Random Forest gave promising results with high recall and precision for the fraud class.

## Future Improvements

* Deploy the model as an API using Flask or FastAPI
* Real-time fraud detection with streaming data
* Experiment with deep learning methods (e.g., Autoencoders)
* Integrate with alerting systems for immediate response

## Acknowledgments

* The dataset was originally made available on Kaggle.
* Inspired by real-world applications of fraud detection systems.
